# Config for phase 1 of 2 of e2e regression tests.
# See also ensure_consistent_config.sh
#
# Phase 1 runs all block-based analyzers; phase 2 runs all others. This is a slightly hacky
# but low-effort way to ensure that all non-block analyzers perform RPCs at a deterministic
# height and therefore always hit the RPC cache. (Most EVM-related analyzers make RPCs at the
# maximum height that's been reached by block analyzers by that point.)
#
# Keep most changes in sync with the edenfast_2025 suite.
