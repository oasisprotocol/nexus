name: mock # This name appears in GitHub's Checks API and in workflow's status badge.

# THIS WORKFLOW:
#   Is special, and only a workaround for limitations in Github's CI config.
#   When a PR touches only changelog .md files, most CI workflows do not run.
#   However, our branch protection rules still require that the jobs in those
#   workflows _pass_; them being skipped is not good enough for Github.
#
#   This workflow creates mock success statuses for all the jobs that would
#   otherwise run in regular CI workflows, and triggers exactly when the regular
#   CI workflows don't.
