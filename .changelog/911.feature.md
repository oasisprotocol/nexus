Implement support for ROFL applications

Two ROFL-related analyzer were added. To enable them, use the `rofl_{runtime}`
and `rofl_instance_transactions_{runtime}` config fields.

Added API endpoints:

- `{runtime}/rofl_apps` - returns a list of ROFL applications

- `{runtime}/rofl_apps/{id}` - return a specific ROFL application

- `/{runtime}/rofl_apps/{id}/transactions` - returns a list of management
transactions of the ROFL application

- `/{runtime}/rofl_apps/{id}/instance_transactions` - returns a list of
transactions submitted by instances of the ROFL application

- `/{runtime}/rofl_apps/{id}/instances` - returns a list of ROFL instances for
the given ROFL application

- `/{runtime}/rofl_apps/{id}/instances/{rak}/transactions` - returns a list of
transactions submitted by the given ROFL instance
