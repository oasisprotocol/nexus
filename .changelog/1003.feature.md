api/accounts: Mark accounts belonging to validators

Two fields added to `/v1/consensus/accounts/{addr}` response:

- `entity_node_for`: The entity address, if this account is a
node belonging to an entity.

- `entity`: The entity address, if this account *is* an entity. If present,
this address should match the queried address `{addr}`.
