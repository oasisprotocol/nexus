storage/runtime: Support method filter for native transfers

Two special values for `method` filter are added:

- `method=native_transfers`: Returns "likely to be native" transactions
  - All accounts.Transfer transactions and EVM Calls with empty data

- `method=evm.Call_no_native`: Returns EVM Calls which are not "likely to be
native" transfers
