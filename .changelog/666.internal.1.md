Tool for faster adding of Changelog fragments

The new Changelog flow can be cumbersome as it requires developers to

- remember to always create a fragment
- adhere to strict linting rules when writing the fragment
- use the PR number in the fragment name even though it might not exist yet

The script takes most of this tedium away by autoformatting and auto-fetching
(or creating) the PR number.
