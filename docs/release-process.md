# Release Process

The following steps are needed to create a release.

Create a tag on the commit that should be released:

```bash
export VERSION=v0.0.1
git tag --sign --message="Version ${VERSION}" "${VERSION}"
```

Push the tag upstream:

```bash
git push origin "${VERSION}"
```

This will trigger the `release` GitHub Action that will create and publish a
release, together with the changelog with changes since the previous release.
Commit messages are used to generate the changelog.
